## Greetings 👋  
### I'm Lan Vukušič, welcome to my github   

### Quick about me ⚡  
I'm a student of "Faculty of computer and Information science in Ljubljana". I've been coding for my past 6 years as a part of my study and for my personal interest.
Coding in python and web development has been my priority in the last few years and I have gained much experience with it. 

My main strengths are writing software that manipulate web data, such as data scrapping and gathering aswell as automated testing software with scripted browsers.  
I have some experiance with data analysis with tools like pandas, numpy and matplotlib, which complement my webscrapping knowledge really nice.  

### Work / professional experience 💼
I worked as a freelancer. My main strength is data scrapping and gathering followed by proccessing and data cleaning.
I have landed a couple of projects in that field. Some were unpaid work for personal projects and some were paid jobs [paid jobs](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01c1940c109bd729f8). I feel most comfortable in this field due to my web developement knowledge and knowledge in data preprocessing.

### I’m currently learning 🎓
I have been tinkering with machine learning and Tensorflow in particular, but i can't yet say, that i am comfortable in that field. I have read quite some theory behind it but I need some hands on projects in order to perform well on such tasks  

### My current hobby projects ✈️ 
RC airplane model building really sparked my attention so my hobby project is creating a flight controller for autonomous radio controlled plane. Built with raspberyPi and cheap component available from aliexpress, i believe it would be great module, many people can benefit from. Thanks to my group of closed firends i believe we can achieve it and make the code public by the end of this year!!
