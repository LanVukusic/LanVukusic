## hey 👋  
### I'm Lan Vukušič

### Quick about me ⚡  
I'm a student of "Faculty of computer and Information science in Ljubljana". I've been coding for my past 7 years as a part of my study and for my personal interest.


### Work / professional experience 💼
I worked as a freelancer. My main strength is data scrapping and gathering followed by proccessing and data cleaning.
I have landed a couple of projects in that field. Some completed projects are visible [here](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01c1940c109bd729f8). I feel most comfortable in this field due to my web developement knowledge and knowledge in data preprocessing.

I'm currently working in a lab at my UNI.  
Im mostly programming for the web (frontend and backend) and taking care that all microservices run smoothly. 

### I’m currently learning 🎓
I have been tinkering with machine learning and Tensorflow in particular, but I can't yet say, that i am comfortable in that field. I have read quite some theory behind it but I need some hands on projects in order to perform well on such tasks  
I recently completed a course  on [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/ZZ4PE8K8BXWW)

### My side projects ✈️ 
__Hardware__  
My future plane project is based on some hardware with no libraries for GO.  
Im writing them:
- [RaspiGPS satellite](https://github.com/LanVukusic/RaspiGPS) is working fine
