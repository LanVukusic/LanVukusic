## Greetings 👋  
### I'm Lan Vukušič, welcome to my github   

### Quick about me ⚡  
I'm a student of "Faculty of computer and Information science in Ljubljana". I've been coding for my past 6 years as a part of my study and for my personal interest.
Coding in python and web development has been my priority in the last few years and I have gained much experience with it. 

My main strengths are writing software that manipulate web data, such as data scrapping and gathering aswell as automated testing software with scripted browsers.  
I have some experiance with data analysis with tools like pandas, numpy and matplotlib, which complement my webscrapping knowledge really nice.  

### Work / professional experience 💼
I worked as a freelancer. My main strength is data scrapping and gathering followed by proccessing and data cleaning.
I have landed a couple of projects in that field. Some were unpaid work for personal projects and some were [paid jobs](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01c1940c109bd729f8). I feel most comfortable in this field due to my web developement knowledge and knowledge in data preprocessing.

### I’m currently learning 🎓
I have been tinkering with machine learning and Tensorflow in particular, but I can't yet say, that i am comfortable in that field. I have read quite some theory behind it but I need some hands on projects in order to perform well on such tasks  
I recently completed a course  on [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/ZZ4PE8K8BXWW)

### My side projects ✈️ 
__RC modeling__  
RC airplane model building really sparked my attention so my hobby project is creating a flight controller for autonomous radio controlled plane. Built with raspberyPi and cheap component available from aliexpress, i believe it would be great module, many people can benefit from. Thanks to my group of closed firends i believe we can achieve it and make the code public by the end of this year!!

__Stage lighting__  
I have worked as a stage lighting designer and operator for three years now and I love my job! Budget lighting consoles don't offer too much costumizability and options to extend your hardware, so I have a couple of projects in progress to make my (and other operators) life easier:  
* _Programming tricks list:_ https://github.com/LanVukusic/Chamsys_MagicQ_tricks  
* _MIDI controll software:_  WIP; software that lets you controll MagicQ consoles with any midi controller
